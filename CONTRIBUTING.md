# How to contribute

Bug reports and pull requests from users are what keep this project working.

# Contribution guidelines

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.

- If a relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
- If no relevant issue exists, open a new issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

## Steps

1. Create an issue and describe your idea
2. [Fork it](https://github.com/ArunSelvam11/NewPipe-UITests.git/fork)
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
5. Publish the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request
